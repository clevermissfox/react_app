# EDICO Designs Portfolio Project

This project was created with React, Firebase, and Supabase; Its still in progress but is a representation of a desktop oS with the user's preference between Windows oS and Mac oS for the Theme toggle. This imitation will eventually have:

- Portfolio images that open an iFrame to their live codepen
- Downloadable resume
- Booking Calendar
- 'Email' client for contact form
- For mobile screen sizes, toggle between Android oS and iOS
- Ability to open multiple file explorers at the same time

## Disclaimer: This will not have all the functionality as a desktop computer; It is just a fun interface and hopefully an interesting UX but is an emulation not an exact replica
